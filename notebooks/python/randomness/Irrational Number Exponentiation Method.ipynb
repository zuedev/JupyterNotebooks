    "# Irrational Number Exponentiation Method\n",
    "\n",
    "This method is based on the idea that performing arithmetic operations on irrational numbers like $pi$ or $e$ can \"shuffle\" their digits in a complex way. The fractional part of the result appears random.\n",
    "\n",
    "We take a base irrational number (like $pi$). We add an integer counter (our \"seed\") to it and raise the result to a large, non-integer power. The fractional part of this result is taken as the random number. By simply incrementing the integer counter for each call, we get a different result each time.\n",
    "\n",
    "This method can be described by a sequence based on a counter. Let $C_n$ be the counter at step $n$, $R_n$ be the random number, and $b$, $p$ be constants (e.g., $b=e$ and $p=10 pi$):\n",
