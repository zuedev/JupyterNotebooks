    "# Trigonometric Chaos Method\n",
    "\n",
    "This method leverages the sensitive and chaotic-like nature of the sine function when its input is large. Small changes in the input to `sin()` can produce large, seemingly unrelated changes in the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "We start with a seed. We take the `sin` of that seed, multiply it by a large number to stretch the output, and then take the fractional part of the result. This new fractional number becomes our random output, and the full result becomes the seed for the next iteration, creating a feedback loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "This method can be described as a recursive sequence. Let $S_n$ be the seed at step $n$, $R_n$ be the random number generated at step $n$, and $k$ be a large constant (like 10000):\n",
